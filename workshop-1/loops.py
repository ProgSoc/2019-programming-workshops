# ACTIVITY TIME (5 min) - again!! :)
# this time we're going to be creating a working weapon system, it will be equipped on the newest Russian IFV, designation Курганец-25
# firstly, you should reload 4 Kornet rounds, then check for targets (all print statements)
# then create a while loop that will rapidly fire off 4 rounds until empty (print statements - end by setting 'ammo = False' or similar)
