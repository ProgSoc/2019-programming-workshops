# basic operators

# Subtract the values
print("10 - 20 =", num1 - num2)
# Multiply the values
print("10 * 20 =", num1 * num2)
# Divide the values - left divided by right (and much more!)
print("10 / 20 =", num1 / num2)
# Modulus, gives remainder of the divided values
print("10 % 20 =", num1 % num2)

# comparison operators

# Returns True if the two values are equal (otherwise returns False)
print("Is 10 == 20 ?", num1 == num2)
# Returns True if left is greater than right (otherwise returns False)
print("Is 10 > 20 ?", num1 > num2)
# Returns True if left is less than right (otherwise returns False)
print("Is 10 < 20 ?", num1 < num2)
# Returns True if left is greater than or equal to right (otherwise returns False)
print("Is 10 >= 20 ?", num1 >= num2)
# Returns True if left is less than or equal to right (otherwise returns False)
print("Is 10 <= 20 ?", num1 <= num2)


# ACTIVITY TIME!!!! (5 min)
# this is going to be a simple algorithm for imaginary numbers! (just kidding)

# we're actually going to make a few print statements that figure out how many bags of chips i can buy with $5,000
# if i have $5,000 and a bag of chips cost $3.10, how many bags can i buy?
# now, if i were to eat one of those bags every week, how many years would my bags of chips last?

# that's some quick maths!
# TIP: make sure your first calculation is efficient, it should return a whole number, no decimal places (integer)
