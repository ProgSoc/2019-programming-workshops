def powerOf(num1, num2):
    return pow(num1,num2)

# ACTIVITY TIME!!! (10 min)
# create a function that takes my available times (morning, afternoon, evening) and weekdays (mon, tues, wed, thurs, fri)
# also my regular number of working hours and pay rate, then calculates my weekly, fortnightly, annual (52 weeks) payslip...

# BONUS POINTS for the acceptance of "halfDay" with an extra boolean/variable
# and "overtimeHours" integer, which will be calculated with a set rate of 1.5 times the pay rate -- GOOD LUCK!!! :)
