# Variables, Strings, Operators and Concatenation

name = 'Harry Potter'
age = 21
isStudent = True # Notice how 'Student' is capitalized whilst 'is' isn't? (This is called camelCasing!)
print('My name is', name)
# You can also concatenate strings with '+', but python only concatenates strings when you use the '+' symbol (and it doesn't add a space)
print('My name is ' + name)
print('I am', age, 'years old')
print('Am I a student?', isStudent)

# We can add the values of variables together
num1 = 10
num2 = 20
print("10 + 20 =", num1 + num2)
